[Measuring the weight](https://makersportal.com/blog/2019/5/12/arduino-weighing-scale-with-load-cell-and-hx711) of a container (tank, reactor, cylinder) is a common problem in chemical plants. Low cost weight sensors are available for small devices although they can easily measure weights up to hundred kilos.
