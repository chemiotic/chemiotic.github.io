From the pubblication Abstract:

 In this paper, a simple method battery charge controller has been designed to protect the battery from over-charging and deep discharges.  The control of the process is entrusted to Arduino Uno board, that must be able to find out the battery state and determine when the charge process must be finished. The state of the battery is perfectly controlled all the time. The use of an Arduino Uno based on microcontroller has been considered in order to allow a good flexibility, to simplify the hardware required (only a few external components are used), and to provide an intelligent tool to undertake, through the programmed algorithm. A buck DCDC Converter has been used to step down voltage from the panel photovoltaic to charge voltage of the battery. This paper presents a comparison between the simulation and practical realization results of the device. A good agreement is obtained.
