Researchers at the University of Toronto Scarborough have, for the first time, [turned waste cooking oil](https://www.utoronto.ca/news/u-t-researchers-turn-mcdonald-s-deep-fryer-oil-high-end-3d-printing-resin) – from the deep fryers of a local McDonald’s – into a high-resolution, biodegradable 3D printing resin.
“The reasons plastics are a problem is because nature hasn’t evolved to handle human-made chemicals,” says Andre Simpson, a professor at U of T Scarborough’s department of physical and environmental sciences who developed the resin in his lab.
