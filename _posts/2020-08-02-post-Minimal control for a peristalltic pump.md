In some cases you do not want to have avery sophisticated control on your pump. Simple automation is made with [a minimal circuit](http://www.learningaboutelectronics.com/Articles/Peristaltic-pump-circuit-with-an-arduino-microcontroller.php). Just a transistor and a diode are required. Of course, only off on control is made but it is more than enough in many cases.

See how it works in the next video.
