An [Intelligent Gas Meter](https://hackaday.com/2021/01/31/old-gas-meter-gets-smart-with-the-esp8266/) was built from a standard device.The meter has a magnet attached to the counter disk which activated an internal hall sensor. With some hacking, it is possible to attach an external Hall-effect sensor to pick up this magnet and use the signal to monitor his daily gas consumption.
