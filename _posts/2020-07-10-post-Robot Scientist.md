From the University of Liverpool in the U.K, Andrew Cooper, tells Inverse that this [new robotic companion](https://www.inverse.com/innovation/robot-chemist-advances-science) to chemistry labs stands apart from other types of scientific robotics in one crucial way.

In this study, the robot was tasked with helping scientists discover a new photocatalyst -- a chemical that when exposed to sunlight would separate into hydrogen and water. These catalysts are incredibly important for clean energy production because they allow hydrogen to be collected without fossil fuel use. But finding an optimized catalyst is like looking for a needle in a haystack.
