Standford build a [dosing system](https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/build-a-sophisticated-microscope-using-lego-3d-printing-arduinos-and-a-raspberry-pi) to automate biology experiemnts.

Modern biology labs often use robotic assemblies to drop precise amounts of fluids into experimental containers. Now, researchers have shown how to adapt a Lego robotics kit to do this for much less money.

Standfor Medicine Team said:

“The robots are designed to pipette fluids from and into cuvettes and multiple-well plates — types of plastic containers commonly used in laboratories. Depending on the specific design, the robots can handle liquid volumes far smaller than 1 microliter, a droplet about the size of a single coarse grain of salt. **Riedel-Kruse believes that these Lego designs might even be useful for specific professional or academic liquid-handling tasks that normally require robots costing many thousands of dollars.**".
