Scientists from the University of Nottingham have developed [a new way to control harmful fungi](https://phys.org/news/2020-06-scientists-unique-polymer-coating-tackle.html), without the need to use chemical bioactives like fungicides or antifungals.
They have developed an innovative solution to tackle fungi, by passively blocking fungal attachment to surfaces using a coating of (meth)acrylate polymers, and so negating the need to use potentially harmful anti-fungals or other bioactive chemicals.
The materials were not toxic, supporting their passive utility. The team developed a formulation with the materials for inkjet-based 3-D printing. Printed voice-prosthesis components showed up to 100% reduction in C. albicans biofilm versus commercial materials.
