Y.Wang,Z.Chi, System of Wireless Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Based on Arduino Uno platform, 20th International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC) October 13-15, 2016 Sinaia Romania


From the pubblication Abstract:

â€”Choose ATmega328 microcontroller that based on the Arduino Uno platform as the core of the control system. Using temperature&humidity sensor DHT11 to collect data of temperature and humidity. The processed data transmitted through nRF24L01 wireless transceiver module. Finally, displaying the results of communication on dot-matrix LCD12864. In addition, in order to let it alarm when data beyond the expected range, we can through potentiometer to set low and high limit of temperature and humidity. Comprehensive evaluation, it is a kind of environmental conditions monitoring programme which is low power consumption, low cost, in realtime and remote.
