IBM build a [sophisticated microscope](https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/hands-on/build-a-sophisticated-microscope-using-lego-3d-printing-arduinos-and-a-raspberry-pi) using Lego, 3D Rpinting, Arduinos and Rasberry Pi.

A DIY experiemnt at IBM Research - Zurich became a valuable tool.

â€œTwo years ago, I was asked to provide high-quality photos and videos of our microfluidic chips for a big tech event. I borrowed a 4K camcorder from a colleague, attached a macro lens to it, built a custom light diffuser using an LED matrix and polyester film, and positioned everything using a high-end tripod and a few micromanipulators".
