DIY Raspberry Pi: [AirPi climate sensor](https://www.dailymercury.com.au/news/diy-raspberry-pi-airpi-climate-sensor/2004091/).

Connecting a series of pollution and climate sensors to the Pi and writing a Python programme to recognise and track these levels, the duo then uploaded the results onto a website that others can add their local data, too.

Soon, enthusiasts from around the world were using the instructions on Hartley and Dayan's website to build their own AirPi's, and adding their data to the duo's nascent weather network.
