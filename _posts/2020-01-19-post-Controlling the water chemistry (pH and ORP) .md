In this project,an Arduino used for [monitoring and controlling the pH and ORP in the slurry continuously] (https://discourse.littlebird.com.au/t/controlling-the-water-chemistry-ph-and-orp-by-an-arduino/122). The idea was to introduce a technology to determine the pH and ORP in the slurry and controls the pumps automatically to keep the level at the set point.
