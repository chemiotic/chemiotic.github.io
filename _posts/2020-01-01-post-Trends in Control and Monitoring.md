Conclusions are: 

"So where are all these open-source, board-level computers going? With their cheap-as-dirt prices and ever-increasing power and speed, anywhere their users want to apply them. Their presence is already multiplying in the hobbyist and consumer sectors, which likely guarantees their growth on the plant floor, too.  

Panacea's Jog adds, "Some of our engineers are active in Raspberry Pi and similar maker communities, and we see it filtering into the automation industry as well. Suppliers can't continue to sell a $5,000 device when a $100 one is available. The first company that comes up with a virtual controller running on a standard server is going to do disrupt the current business model, and do a lot of business.

"However, this also means the job of process control engineer is no longer just about controlling valves and loops. When you're managing networks, servers and cloud, you need to know a lot more. Twenty years ago, control engineers tuned loops, which got a little simpler with auto-tuning software. As we transitioned to PLCs programming them was valued more than traditional tuning skills. What's going on now is just another transition, and we can make it through this one, too."

Schneider's Zagar adds that, "I'm not really worried about board-level computers putting traditional controllers out of business. I'm excited because we can all learn and make good use of these tools. Customers are asking about the cloud because they want to improve their bottom lines, but there's still a lot of hesitation about using more DIY-oriented technologies. However, we're not talking about using them for mission-critical tasks or using them to tamper with equipment. I think DIY devices suffer because they've traditionally been used for one-off projects, so their developers and users don't think about lifecycle issues or what to do if they fail. However, that's exactly what control and automation professionals do, and tools like Raspberry Pi and Node-RED can help join the plant to IIoT and the cloud, and allow better decisions than with the usual plant data."
