A [ESP32 improved](https://hackaday.com/2020/11/22/espressif-leaks-esp32-c3-a-wifi-soc-thats-risc-v-and-is-esp8266-pin-compatible/) version is going to be realised soon. The ESP32 is one of the most used board for wireless application. AN improved version with a neew processor is a good news. However, we hope that document and examples are soon available.
