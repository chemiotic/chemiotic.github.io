[A passive dispenser device](http://brianisett.com/2016/06/21/diy-water-delivery-a-simple-passive-water-flow-system-precise-to-the-level-of-microliters/#sol-circuit) is a great and stable solution for many chemical activities. The idea for passive dispensors is to use gravity as the driving force for our water delivery system. We gate the flow of water using a “Normally Closed” solenoid, which we drive open for certain amounts of time using a simple circuit (described below). The longer we open the solenoid, the more water flows through! Since I am interested in delivering very small amounts of water (1-4ul), the solenoid needs to be able to open and close in 10s of milliseconds

The figure shows the basic logic of how to set up a water reservoir using a 60ml syringe, and a solenoid. It includes a manual way to close off the water flow (the one-way stopcock). This comes is handy if you need to disconnect the rest of the tubing for any reason, or if the solenoid starts misbehaving (to stop water from going everywhere).
