From the pubblication Abstract:

This work describes a Simulink lab practice using Arduino as low cost hardware. A Shell must be developed in order to adapt Arduino signals to the real plant, consist of a DC motor. With Arduino architecture and with open hardware a cheap Data Acquisition card has been build. Several tests have been done to validate de full system and a frequency study has been completed in order to know the possibilities of the proposed architecture in the control of new other plants. Finally, a lab exercise using the Simulink and Arduino system is proposed to the student of engineering bachelors. The exercise consisting of apply the empirical method of Ziegler-Nichols for adjust a PID controller, testing this controller over the experimental plant.
