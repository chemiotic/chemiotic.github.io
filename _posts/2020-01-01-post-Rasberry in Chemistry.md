The Chemistry Department of the [University of Cambridge](https://cambridgechemlib.wordpress.com/2017/11/21/try-a-raspberry-pi-in-the-chemistry-library/) uses open hardware boards.


The Chemistry Library has made two Raspberry Pis available for researchers from the Department of Chemistry to use (in the Library only) on a ‘try before you buy’ basis. **They are intended to provide inspiration and ideas for researchers on how they can use Raspberry Pis in their research projects.**
