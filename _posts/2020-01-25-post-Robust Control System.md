From the pubblication Abstract:

This paper presents the capability of Arduino for responding to the robust controller which has been applied to the 3 phase rectifier and 3 phase inverter. The interface between the converters and the Arduino has been established by using MATLAB-Simulink environment. This is the fastest interface due the Arduino library that is available in the MATLAB which can be used before downloading the program to the board. Two types of controllers have been tested which are, P-Resonant and Fuzzy-PI controller. The voltage or current feedback mechanism also has been applied between the converters with the Arduino input port in order for responding to the design controller for signal generating pattern. At the end, it shows that, the Arduino is capable to receive the signals from the converters, process the signals in the board and generating the signal out for controlling the converters
