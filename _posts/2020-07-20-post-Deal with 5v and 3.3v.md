[Voltage level shifter](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-5v-to-33v-Logic-Level-Shifter/) is most handly solution to a very common problem. Some sensors work at 5 VDC and some others at 3.3 VDC, so should I have to provide to power sources at different tension ?. No, if you use a level shifter. Moreover this device is used when you want to connect different boards that work at different tensions (e.g. Arduino and ESP32). The link gives you the easiest solution although more reliable and stable ones are available.
