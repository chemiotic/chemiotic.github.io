Arduinos are some of the most popular microcontrollers in the maker movement and are also prevalent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education. These boards integrate and link controls (such as buttons) to real-world actions (turning a motor, for example) through a control program. Yet, as you might expect, it’s sometimes desirable to eliminate physical controls from a project in favor of wireless interaction through an intuitive, electronics-free user interface (UI). That’s where [RemoteXY](https://all3dp.com/2/remotexy-arduino-control-guide/) comes into play.
