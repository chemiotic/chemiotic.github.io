The easy measurement of [enviromental parameters by wireless tools](https://www.instructables.com/id/Wireless-Temperature-and-Humidity-Monitor-With-ESP/) is massively investigated nowaday.
The goal of this project is to make a temperature/humidity monitor that wirelessly logs the temperature and humidity to a remote server.

Moreover, several other papers are available, where more scientific details are given. Seee: [System of Wireless Temperature and Humidity Monitoring Based on Arduino Uno Platform] (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7774887)
