[Solenoid valves](https://bc-robotics.com/tutorials/controlling-a-solenoid-valve-with-arduino/) are quite common in chemical plant. There are many types of solenoid, for instance, there are solenoid valves which can be used to open or close water or gas pipelines and there are solenoid plungers which are used to produce linear motion. Even at small scale they are useful to control and dose the liquid addition. Their use can improved if a reliabe control of can be done by some software. For small plant Arduino board can be an easy customizable initiative. See details in the original reference.
