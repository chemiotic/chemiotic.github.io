A [Current sensor](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-Current-Sensor-20/) is a very useful tool in chemistry. It can be used to measure the power of any kind of DC driver and engine. The main problem is to find reliable device precise enough for our purpose. Find detailed instruction to realize a module and test it.

The project is made by the Arduino team and you can find additional information [here] (https://blog.arduino.cc/2020/12/28/this-diy-current-sensor-measures-up-to-15a-and-displays-it-on-an-oled-screen/).
