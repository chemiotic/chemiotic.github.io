Thermocouples are digital thermometers that are both accurate and suitable for the searing hot fires of a wood oven. They are made of two types of very specific metals, that when heated or cooled generate a voltage across their terminals. The PiMometer uses Type K thermocouples, made of alumel (alloy of nickel, aluminum, and other metals) and chromel (alloy of nickel and chromium). Type Ks are good up to 2,000Â°F. The voltage generated by the thermocouple depends on the change in temperature. This voltage is very small, only a few thousandths of a volt, so it must be amplified before it can be measured. While there are analog thermocouple amplifiers out there, the PiMometer uses a digital chip, the MAX31855. This chip requires no external components and can provide the temperature to the nearest half of a degree. The temperature is provided back to the Raspberry Pi using a protocol called Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI).
