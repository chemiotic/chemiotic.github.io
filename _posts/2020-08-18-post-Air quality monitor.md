An [Air Quality Monitor](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/diy-air-quality-monitor-pm2-5-co2-voc-ozone-temp-hum-arduino-meter/) is the scope of this project. Particulate is a pollutant in the air that need to be controlled and this can be done with low cost sensors like those described in the project.

If a DYI solution is not satisfactory for you, you can read a review of the sensors for air quality [here](https://www.techhive.com/article/3600840/davis-instruments-airlink-review.html), whwere some commercial devices are presented.
