A low-cost method to produce electrolyzed salt water, an [all-purpose sanitizer.] (https://www.hackster.io/350089/electrolyzed-water-disinfectant-device-27d130)
During the COVID-19 pandemic, effective disinfectants and sanitizers have become more crucial than ever before. When used properly, they can greatly reduce the spread of the virus. However, the increased demand for these cleaners has led to a drop in their global availability.

Many commercial producers of electrolyzed water rely on expensive equipment to produce it, which makes it a relatively illogical choice for many everyday consumers and those in struggling communities. But our device scales down the process to a household-friendly level, greatly cutting down the cost as a result. The smaller size also ensures that a more appropriate amount of electrolyzed water is produced -- as its shelf life is typically only a few weeks. We believe our device could give many families access to a cheaper yet highly-effective home sanitizer that would help protect them from the virus.
