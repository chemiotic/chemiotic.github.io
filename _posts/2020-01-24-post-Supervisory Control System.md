From the pubblication Abstract:

This paper designs a web-based Arduino supervisory control system. Arduino controller is utilized as a local controller to fit into a supervisory control framework. The framework includes a central server, a SMS device attached to the server, multiple local controllers, a remote control program and a ladder logic computer-aided design program. The Arduino controller contains an Arduino USB board and an Ethernet shield. The USB board provides basic input/output and processing power, while the Ethernet shield provides TCP/IP connection capability. The Arduino controller communicates with supervisory server with a specific m2m protocol which is based on http protocol. In this paper, the http protocol and m2m protocol is fulfilled based on TCP connection in an Arduino controller. Once an Arduino controller is plugged into the supervisory control system, it can be monitored and controlled remotely with any browser. The web-based Arduino supervisory control system is used to provide remote supervisory control service of water pumping systems of multistorey buildings scattered in big Taipei area by a small company.
