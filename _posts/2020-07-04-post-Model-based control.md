[Model-based control](https://www.controlglobal.com/articles/2020/raspberry-pi-vs-plc-for-model-based-control/) Raspberry Pi vs programmable logic controllers

**In 2017, Control’s sister publication, Control Design, published an article demonstrating how an Arduino single-board microcontroller for do-it-yourself applications could control a flow loop when integrated with industrial-grade instruments and control devices.** It compared this inexpensive “maker” approach to using a simple and commercially available industrial programmable logic controller (PLC) configured to carry out the identical task.

The widespread interest generated suggested a follow-up investigation using more complex controllers for more demanding processes. The new challenge: performing model-based control with two input variables using a Raspberry Pi, compared to performing the same task with a basic PLC.
