University of Oregon chemists have made substantial gains in enhancing the [catalytic water dissociation](https://phys.org/news/2020-07-scientists-dissociate-efficiently-catalysts.html) reaction in electrochemical reactors, called bipolar membrane electrolyzers, to more efficiently rip apart water molecules into positively charged protons and negatively charged hydroxide ions.
That finding could lead to improved electrocatalysts for reactions that directly make reduced fuels from water, such as making hydrogen gas or liquid fuel from waste carbon dioxide.
