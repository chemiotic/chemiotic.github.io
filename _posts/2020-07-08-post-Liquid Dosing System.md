[Liquid Dosing System](https://i2.wp.com/makezine.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/img_20131217_170941.jpg?resize=1024%2C768&ssl=1) is a very common apparatus usefull for many applications: food, cosmetic, detergency and pharma.

The proposed example shows the a simple Cocktail Drinkbot but the precision of dosage is helpful in alla cases. The low cost hardware and software are enclosed.

Peristaltic pumps are used to deliver specific amounts of liquids and use a rolling ball mechanism in a section of flexible tube. These pumps are common in the food and medical industries. The smaller versions used in this project are common in the aquarium industry where they deliver chemicals to fish tanks. The peristaltic pumps I used are able to pump 30 ml in 32 seconds. Be sure to test the delivery amount of any pump you use. I initially tested my pumps with water to get a close timing before having to adjust the times for the different liquids that had different viscosities and pumping speeds.
