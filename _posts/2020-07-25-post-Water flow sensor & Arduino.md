From the [well-done website](https://www.electroschematics.com/working-with-water-flow-sensors-arduino/) , get this interesting application.

Effective water management involves supplying water according to the real requirement, and thus measuring water is very essential step in water management systems. There are many water flow measurement techniques as well as different types of water flow meters used to measure the volume of water flow in pipelines but these all are too costly. This article describes ideas for design and development of low cost automatic water flow meters, with the help of readily-available and low-cost water flow sensors.
