In everyday praxis, we often need demonstration measuring devices (thermometers, pH meters, etc.), with large enough displays to be easily readable from every point in the classroom. Here, we present some of the capabilities of the [Arduino platform for the school environment](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ed5008102). This microprocessor board can be used for inexpensive construction of measuring devices for demonstrations and experiments performed by students in chemistry.

By the term **“ChemDuino”** (portmanteau of “chemistry” and “Arduino”) we mean the general practice of applying the Arduino hardware and software (e.g., Wiring and OneWire) to improve chemistry teaching and learning.
