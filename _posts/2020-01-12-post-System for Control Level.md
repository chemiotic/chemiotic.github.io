From the pubblication Abstract:

Nowadays, a great variety of industrial processes has an extreme necessity of improving the quality of controlled tanks level, due to the fact that this type of control and process is widely found in the industrial environment. The objective of this work consists to create a tank system, aiming to represent in small scale an industrial level process, seeking exemplify applications, modes of use and control techniques. Firstly, there is the need to identify the system response of the open-loop to be adjusted the best controller, in accordance with the best method of tuning. As control platform, Arduino microcontroller was used to establish a serial communication with a PC workstation. The results were quite satisfactory considering its functionality in industrial systems, represented in small scale.

Another interesting reference measuring Level is [comparing different sensors and technologies](https://ettron.com/water-level-indicator-project-controller-using-ultrasonic-sensor-arduino/). 
They high light the advantages of a contactless sensor vs the tradtional ones.
