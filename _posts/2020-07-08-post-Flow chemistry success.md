Cardiff University scientists have devised a new way of making reactions up to 70 times faster by using [state-of-the-art equipment](https://phys.org/news/2020-07-chemicals-faster-reactions.html) to spin chemicals around.
The idea is based on flow chemistry, in which chemical reactions take place continuously in a flowing stream of liquid within a tube or a pipe, as opposed to more traditional "batch production" methods when chemicals are added into a vessel such as a flask and the product is then collected.

Flow chemistry is changing the way chemical reactions are performed, providing safer, faster reactions, and cleaner products.
