Sparkfun present a board with [Tensorflow embedded](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15170). The power of the best libriry for neural network analysis at a incredibly low cost.

Several ideas for developping new sensors are now open.

Sparkfun defines:

“In collaboration with Google and Ambiq, SparkFun's Edge Development Board is based around the newest edge technology and is perfect for getting your feet wet with voice and even gesture recognition without relying on the distant services of other companies. The truly special feature is in the utilization of Ambiq Micro's latest Apollo3 Blue microcontroller, whose ultra-efficient ARM Cortex-M4F 48MHz (with 96MHz burst mode) processor, is spec’d to run TensorFlow Lite using only 6uA/MHz.
