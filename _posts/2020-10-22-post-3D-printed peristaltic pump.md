Micropumps are essential in flow chemistry. [3D printed](https://blog.arduino.cc/2021/12/27/this-3d-printed-arduino-controlled-kit-makes-microfluidic-pumps-more-accessible/) are continously proposed in maker projects. This study proposed a sofisticated model that developped in a kit and explained in a [paper](https://www.hardware-x.com/article/S2468-0672(21)00031-6/fulltext).
