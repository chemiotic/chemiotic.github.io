From the pubblication Abstract:

â€”In this study, the Arduino is used to build a low-cost data acquisition card with its sampling frequency of up to 50k Hz, so sampling frequency can also be applied to adjust the signal measurement of different frequencies through the program. In this paper, utility power signals are used to measure the target, and the analog signals captured through Arduino from the measured power transport signals are converted into digital signals, which are then transmitted through a Wi-Fi module to an Android mobile device so that mobile devices can display the signal waveform transmitted by Arduino. Via a Fourier digital filtering algorithm, signal noise and high harmonics are filtered out, and then the zero crossing algorithm is applied to accurately calculate the fundamental frequency of the power signal. Because the power signal is an AC signal of high-voltage, this study designs a voltage Step-down circuit as signal pre-processing to adjust the signal level to the standard level that can be accepted by Arduino. Research confirms this study can design a portable power signal acquisition device to view signal waveforms by an Android APP and calculate the vibration and frequency of signals. In the future data signals via a Wi-Fi Shield will be uploaded to the cloud server.
