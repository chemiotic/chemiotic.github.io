From the pubblication Abstract:

With the increasing popularity of the Internet of Things applications, investors are more willing to invest on small digital electronic products and seek business opportunities. At the same time, along with the improvement of the data processing method, people want to get more accurate data. This paper presents an application that using Arduino and Bluetooth electronic scale to connect to smart phones to obtain weight information of daily water intake. Bluetooth technology is lowpower, it can ensure the reliability of data transmission, and the price is relatively cheap. These features are very suitable to our scale. We use Arduino board as our major application development tools. Arduino's hardware are based on open source platform and using like C or Java development environment to make the development process simple and easy to understand. And on the communication tool, mobile App, we are using Google App Inventor for development. App Inventor is a Legostyle stacking method to accomplish App. The system is combining with an algorithm and applied to water intake for users.
