Liquids or other objects appear colored because they reflect or transmit certain colors and in turn swallow (absorb) others. With a so-called photometer, those colors (wavelengths) can be determined, which are absorbed by liquids. The basic principle is simple: with a LED of a certain color you first shine through a cuvette filled with water or another solvent.
