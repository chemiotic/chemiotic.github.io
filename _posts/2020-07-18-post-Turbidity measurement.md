[A low cost turbidity-meter](http://www.thepulsar.be/article/measuring-turbidity/) is defined and projected. Very useful for emulsion and suspension polymerization monitoring.
Turbidity defines in a quantitative way how cloudy a solution is. It increases with the number of particles in suspension but also depends on the nature of the particles (such as their size). Usually, it is measured by illuminating a sample and check how light is scattered in various directions. Because light can also be absorbed by the sample, it is important to track the ratio between transmitted light and scattered light to prevent spurious results with samples that may contain optically-absorbent chemicals. It should be noted that turbidity is given by the direct ratio of transmitted light and scattered light and not by the log of the ratio, such as in the Beer-Lambert absorption law.
