[Measuring the pH](https://scidle.com/how-to-use-a-ph-sensor-with-arduino/) can be very useful if we are developing an aquarium, a hydroponic or an automated aquaponic. Next we will explain how this sensor works, how we should calibrate it and we will put an example of functional code to use it with Arduino.
