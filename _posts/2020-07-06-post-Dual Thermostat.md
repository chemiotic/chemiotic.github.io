The thermostat was specifically designed so it would not need to be disassembled to mount, program, or attach the heating circuit wires. Itâ€™s also quite possible to program the thermostat (or any Arduino compatible microcontroller) without having to bring your computer or laptop next to the device. IOGEAR makes a very nice Wireless 4-Port USB Sharing Station (GUWIP204) which can be used to remotely program the device anywhere you have Wifi coverage. Once the device driver is installed, your computer will think that the remote USB ports on the GUWIP204 are actually local to your computer. Take the Wifi USB Hub to the location where your thermostat is, plug the USB cable from the thermostat into the Wifi USB Hub, power the hub, and program the device remotely.
