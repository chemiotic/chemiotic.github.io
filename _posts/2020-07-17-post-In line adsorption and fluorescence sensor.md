[A in line light adsorption sensor](http://www.thepulsar.be/article/in-line-absorption-and-fluorescence-sensor/) is developped and presented. Very detailied information about physical principles and parts required to develop an efficient sensor. When a light ray hits an atom (or molecule) at the right frequency for a transition to occur, the excited atom (or molecule) has different way to go back to its initial state. Some of them will spontaneously re-emit a photon equivalent to the incoming one, resulting in no overall light loss, and others will decay that excess energy under various forms such as heat. When the incoming photon is not recreated, we say that absorption occurs.
