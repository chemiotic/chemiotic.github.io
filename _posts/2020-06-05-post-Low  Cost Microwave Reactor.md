Ollital (CH) shows a low cost [Microwave Reactor](https://www.ollital.com/chemical-reactor_c120) usefull for analysis and fine chemical synthesis.

Several models are available of different size and power. Apparently, only batch reactions are possible.

Ollital defines:

â€œLab use electric Ultraviolet microwave reactor apply microcomputer technology and  unique technology of microwave adjustment, realizing microwave power continuously adjustable, good repeatability. For experiments that require microwave assisted catalytic reaction conditions, especially for those who require a smaller microwave power and who wish to maintain continuous microwave radiation chemistry experiments, it's an ideal lab apparatus".
