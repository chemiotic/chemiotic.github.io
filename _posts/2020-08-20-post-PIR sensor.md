I do not know if the use of a [PIR sensor](https://hackaday.com/2020/12/24/pir-sensor-in-a-jar-helps-you-keep-your-concentration/) proposed in this project is useful. However the possibility to set up a control on a dangerous device is common in a chemistry laboratory. You can protect from un trianed people tools and instrument that need a care with the same low cost technology.
