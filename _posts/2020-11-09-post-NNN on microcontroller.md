[Neural Networks](https://bdtechtalks.com/2022/01/17/mcunetv2-tinyml-deep-learning-microcontrollers/) is a fast growing technology that handle image and data. A lot of initiatives try to bring then on microcontrollers to improve they use.
The reference shows the use of a new library for this purpose.
