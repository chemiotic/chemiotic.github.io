[OpenDLS, an Open-Source Dynamic Light Scattering:] (https://www.hackster.io/etienner/opendls-an-open-source-dynamic-light-scattering-bff60f)
Affordable and open-source dynamic light scattering device for nanoparticles sizing.

Conclusion:
"This open source DLS device seems very promising for dispersions that scatter enough light to the cheap detector, although the accuracy is still low. We hope that some of the building blocks and code can be useful for other projects."
