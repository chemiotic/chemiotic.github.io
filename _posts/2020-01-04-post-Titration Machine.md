The experimenter said :

"For an Introduction to [Engineering class at Central Arizona College](https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Based-Chemical-Titration-aka-The-Titration/), my team and I decided to build a machine that would use a basic Arduino sensor array to detect the moment that chemical titration has occurred."

Motivation:

"Frankly, we chose this project simply because we had a group consisting of an Electrical Engineer, a Chemical Engineer, a Mechanical Engineer, and a Computer Science major. We wanted to make sure that everyone learned something new!"
