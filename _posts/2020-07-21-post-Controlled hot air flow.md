[Hot air flow](https://www.instructables.com/DIY-SMD-REWORK-STATION/) is useful in many process: drying crystals, powders and polymers. In this Instructable you can learn how to make a hot air gun controller using Arduino and other common components. In this project, PID algorithm is used to calculate the power required and is controlled by a isolated Triac driver.
