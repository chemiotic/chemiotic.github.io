A team from the University of California, Riverside has developed a [LEGO-like system](https://blog.arduino.cc/2016/08/18/a-3d-printed-lego-like-system-for-the-chemistry-and-biology-lab/) of blocks that enables users to make custom chemical and biological research instruments quickly, easily and affordably. The 3D-printed blocks can create various scientific tools, which can be used in university labs, schools, hospitals, or anywhere else.

The team said: "Since the blocks are designed to work together, **users can build apparatus—like bioreactors for making alternative fuels or acid-base titration tools** for high school chemistry classes—rapidly and efficiently. The blocks are especially well-suited for resource-limited settings, where a library of blocks could be utilized to create an assortment of different research and diagnostic equipment."
