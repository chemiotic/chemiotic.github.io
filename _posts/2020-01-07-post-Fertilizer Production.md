Small scale production of [fertilizer directly from ammonia](https://scitechdaily.com/mit-chemical-engineers-develop-technique-to-enable-cheaper-fertilizer-production/). 

MIT shows this leading example.

“In the future, if we envision how we want this to be used someday, we want a device that can breathe in air, take in water, have a solar panel hooked up to it, and be able to produce ammonia. **This could be used by a farmer or a small community of farmers,**” says Karthish Manthiram, an assistant professor of chemical engineering at MIT and the senior author of the study.
