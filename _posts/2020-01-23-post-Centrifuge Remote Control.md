From the pubblication Abstract:

 In this study, types of centrifuges, dc motor structures, MATLAB and ARDUINO sytems that are used to control these structures remotely have been described concisely. The aim of this study is to ensure ease-of-use for centrifuge systems and  lower the workload for the users. At the end of the study, It has been observed that it is very easy to control the centrifuge systems even the control unit is far away than the centrifuge  
systems. In future, it will be possible to integrate the remotely controlled centrifuge systems with biochemical or hormone devices. Blood samples can be placed into the centrifuge systems, the centrifuged blood sample can be analyzed by biochemical and hormome devices and results can be provided by the assistance of a robotic hand that is jointed to this integrated centrifuge system.
