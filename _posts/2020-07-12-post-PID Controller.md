 A PID controller can be easily implemented to regulated a [simple DC motor](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/tareqwaleed1996/pid-speed-controller-for-dc-motor-74e735) or a [whole thermal plant](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896316326970)
 
 
From the paper abstract:

The paper deals with an experimental verification of a filter impact in PID control. It starts with formulation of PI and PID controller tuning for the first order time delayed plant integrated with an additional nth order binomial filter. Then it introduces an Arduino based thermo-opto-mechanical laboratory plant and by experiments with its thermal channel it shows, how the total control effort may significantly be decreased by an appropriate low pass filtering. The improvements may be so significant that the derivative term in control may lead to a performance increase in speed of the transients achieved by a decreased control effort.
