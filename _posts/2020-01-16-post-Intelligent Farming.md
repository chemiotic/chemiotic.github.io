From the pubblication Abstract:

"Internet of Things" (loT) is a technology that allows things to communicate and connect with each other. This will change the patterns and processes in both industry and agriculture towards higher efficiency. Particularly, agriculture is an important foundation of Thai economy. Consequently, we propose an intelligent farming system (IF) to improve the production process in planting. IF composes of two main parts which are a sensor system and a control system. In this paper, we focus on the control part which are watering and roofing systems of an outdoor farm based on the statistical data sensed from the sensor systems (including temperature, humidity, moisture and light intensity sensors) Since the sensed data would not be always accurate due to noises, we apply Kalman filtering to smooth the data before using as an input in our decision making process. For the decision making process, we do not consider only the sensed data, but also the weather information. A decision tree model is generated to predict the weather condition. Then, a set of decision rules based on both the sensed data and the predicted weather condition is developed to automatically make a decision on whether watering and roofing system should be on or off. Moreover, we also provide functions for users to manually control the watering and roofing systems via our mobile application.
