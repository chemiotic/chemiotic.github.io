Multisensors are very interesting because they save space and money. [BME280](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/bme280-sensor-arduino-pressure-temperature-humidity/) is a sensor able to measure temperature, humidity, and pressure. However, it is not always easy to manage it. 
[Problems](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/solved-could-not-find-a-valid-bme280-sensor/) are solved with a careful troubleshooting. See how in the link.
