From the pubblication Abstract:

The present work reports the programming paradigms that have been developed for a temperature monitoring system able to provide accurate data regarding food temperatures inside refrigerated vehicles and alert the driver accordingly, in relation to which temperature states are encountered. The mentioned solution is designed to be cost-efficient and versatile, so that it can compete with available solutions. This paper also contributes with explanations of ideas behind our coding approach and solutions to encountered problems, along with a detailed insight into the flow of execution of our program.
