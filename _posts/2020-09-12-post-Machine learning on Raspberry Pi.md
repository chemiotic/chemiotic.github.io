 Machine learning applications directly on your Rasperry PY? The [Source](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/machine-learning-on-raspberry-pi-just-took-a-big-step-forward/) explains this is possible. A full machine learning platform was sized to fit in the small Raspberry board. Depending of the computational time, this becomes a consistent backthough for several new themes as intelligent sensors.
