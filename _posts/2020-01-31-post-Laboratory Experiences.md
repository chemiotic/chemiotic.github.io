From the pubblication Abstract:

The free hardware platforms have become very important in engineering education in recent years. Among these platforms, Arduino highlights, characterized by its versatility, popularity and low price. This paper describes the implementation of four laboratory experiments for Automatic Control and Robotics courses at the University of Alicante, which have been developed based on Arduino and other existing equipment. Results were evaluated taking into account the views of students, concluding that the proposed experiments have been attractive to them, and they have acquired the knowledge about hardware configuration and programming that was intended.
