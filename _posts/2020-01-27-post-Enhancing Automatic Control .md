From the pubblication Abstract:

Microcontroller Arduino Mega and ATmega is a computer chip that needed and developed to control system or process. Microcontroller Arduino Mega and ATmega can be used to temperature control systems, the room lighting control, security control, the hazard warning [4], scheduling, monitoring water flow and dams actuator door and etc. Most studies on the microcontroller is focused on the functional capability of a microcontroller to read or measure the object. In addition to aspects of good function, microcontroller must have a high sensitivity in order to avoid delay or in-accuracies in the sensor reading measured object such as temperature. Microcontrollers has some advantages and disadvantages of the process accuracy depends on the processor and the ability microcontroller. In this paper focuses on the measurement errors that occur on microcontroller Arduino Mega and ATmega 8535 with a temperature sensor LM 35 and hygrometer digitizes dt05 for the application process cooling and heating sea water controls. The volume of sea water is measured is 3 to 35 litters with a temperature set point 280C of lower temperatures above 250C and 310C. The results show that the maximum error obtained by using microcontroller Arduino Mega is 1,320C or 13,2 mV and ATmega 8535 is 0,20C or 2 mV. Also the microcontroller Arduino Mega is more suitable for control temperature measurement in the process of heating and cooling sea water
