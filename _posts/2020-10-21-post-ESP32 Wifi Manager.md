Improve your connectivity with ESP32 configured as [WiFi Manager](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-wi-fi-manager-asyncwebserver/). The Wi-Fi Manager allows you to connect the ESP32 board to different Access Points (networks) without hard-coding network credentials (SSID and password) and upload new code to your board.
