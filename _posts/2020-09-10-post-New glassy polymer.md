 A new glassy polymer usefull for 3D printing is recentently developped in the Freiburg University. The [Source](https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/freiburg-team-develops-new-polymeric-glass-composite-for-injection-molding-188646/) gives the information directly from the team. The material is usefull by itself as new resistent polymer but it can be seen as a new challange for an automatic production in a 3D printer association.
