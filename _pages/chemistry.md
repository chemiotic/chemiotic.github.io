Chemistry is a quite large science with many different topics. It moves from biochemestry to polymers, from pharmaceutical to varnish, from petrochemistry to green-chemistry just to mention the most update and well-known subjects. However, some general trends tend to move across all these topics when chemicals need to be produced. In our opinion, the most useful and interesting are:

1. [Process Intensification](https://www.epicmodularprocess.com/blog/what-is-process-intensification)

1. [Flow Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_chemistry)

1. [Modular plants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_process_skid)


Through these tools is possible to re-think the most part of the chemistry production. The tendency is quite general, allthogh partially covered by industrial protection and partially released.

A good example is the Flexible, Fast and Future Production Processes [(F3)](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/228867/reporting) sponsored by the European Comunity in 2013.
