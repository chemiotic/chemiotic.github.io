**Chemistry is a fundamental human activity.** We cannont avoid to produce chemical substances. However, we can review the way we make them. Up to now, production tend to be concentrated in large plants. Some drawbacks of this method are coming out:

- concentration of substances increases the risk if they are dangerous

- large production standardizes the product specification to the most strict and expensive

- logistic is stressed in transport and timing

- shortage causes drammatic crisis in price and availability

- pollutant productions geografically migrate instead of improving their ecocompatibility


The solution is quite obvious and already highlighted: delocalized chemical productions in a network of small plant. The chemical production will be sperad out in many more small units because thier results more flexible and versatile.

**But how small these new plants will be?**

The most likely answer will be dependand of the different chemicals. Probably, many productions may move to no-chemical company that have a relevant use of the chemical. For some usefull substances we can preconize a domestic production with a direct recycling of some family waste. **So, more chemistry but managed in an easy and responsible way.**
