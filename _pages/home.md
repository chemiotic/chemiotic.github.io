**Chemiotic** comes from the merge of the two words: Chemistry and Robotic. The new word stresses the wish of the team to produce chemicals with automatic plants for small scale and even domestic production.

Chemistry allways has required and supported automation for safety and reliability. Chemicals only react in precised ratios and under well definited conditions. So, it is not suprising that the two disciplines have a mutual and tide connection. Also the order has is meaning for us, first Chemistry and then Robotics, i.e. we are much more interested in the chemical process than in the way it may be realized. 

There is not limits to the Chemistry we are interested in: polymers, fine chemicals or biomaterials. But Robotics for us is limited to plant automation, sensor development and physical matter interaction.

**What the purpose of this Blog?**

- Collect and share information about the Chemistry and Robotic interactions. 

- Show examples of fruitfull chemical automatic production on small scale.

- Highlight applications of Robotic in Chemistry and Chemistry requiring Robotic.
